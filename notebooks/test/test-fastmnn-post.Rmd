The object comprises:

- A `corrected` matrix in the `reducedDims` slot.
  Note that the number of columns can be controlled by the `d=` argument of `fastMNN()`.
- A `batch` column in the `colData` slot.
  This contains the factor used to identify each sample integrated using `fastMNN()`.
- A `rotation` column the `rowData` slot, containing the rotation matrix used for the PCA.
  The number of rows corresponds to the selecteds genes (default: all) and the number of columns is controlled by the `d=` argument of `fastMNN()`.
- A `reconstructed` matrix in the `assays` slot, containing the low-rank reconstruction of the expression matrix
- Metadata:
  - `merge.info`, a `DataFrame` of diagnostic information about each merge step.
  - `pca.info`, a list of metadata produced by `multiBatchPCA()`.

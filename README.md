A Snakemake workflow for `<description>`

## Usage

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=<owner>%2F<repo>).

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) <repo>sitory and its DOI (see above).

Typical usage:

```bash
# Cleanup
mv sps-* .sps
rm nohup.out

# Working directory
cd $(realpath .) # containers prefer real paths

# Host directories that need mounting to container
#TMP_APPTAINER_ARGS="--bind /var/scratch"
TMP_APPTAINER_ARGS=" --bind /ceph/project/cncb/shared"
TMP_APPTAINER_ARGS+=" --bind /ceph/project/cncb/albrecht"

# Execution
nohup snakemake \
  --sdm conda apptainer \
  --apptainer-args "$TMP_APPTAINER_ARGS" &
```

Then keep an eye on the `nohup.out` file:

```bash
tail -f nohup.out
```

Notes:

- `--bind /var/scratch` binds the directory where Slurm jobs are given a private folder

## Reporting

Export reports to the Datashare directory for sharing:

```bash
rsync -a reports ../../datashare/albrecht/
```

## Visualisation

```bash
snakemake \
  --sdm conda apptainer \
  --apptainer-args "$TMP_APPTAINER_ARGS" \
  --dag \
  | dot -Tsvg \
  > dag.svg
```

## VSCode, Snakemake, Apptainer, Conda, and R

This pipeline was developed using VSCode and extensions.

In particular, VSCode was allowed to create an `renv` library for interactive testing.
The `.Rprofile` file created by `renv` interfered the creation of new Conda environments by Snakemake.
In those instances, the code in the `.Rprofile` file had to be temporarily disabled (commented out) during the Snakemake run creating the new Conda environment.

# TODO

- Generalise script for computing UMAP to receive input dimred as a rule parameter.
- Why do colnames(sce) disappear after fastMNN integration?
- Colour UMAP after integration with sample, timepoint, replicate.

- Replace `<owner>` and `<repo>` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `<repo>` name and owning user or organization.
- Replace `<name>` with the workflow name (can be the same as `<repo>`).
- Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
- The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `<owner>` and `<repo>` were correctly set.
